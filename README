Short Description:

  slack is a configuration management system designed to appeal to lazy
  admins (like me).  It's an evolution from the usual "put files in some
  central directory" that is faily common practice.  It's descended from an
  earlier system I also wrote, called "subsets", and uses a multi-stage
  rsync to fix some of the problems I had there.

  Basically, it's a glorified wrapper around rsync.
