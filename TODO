# TODO
#
# this is a very long (unprioritized list of things that might be nice to have)
# 

- Break a bunch of stuff:
  * get rid of implicit '-e ssh' with a double-colon in SOURCE.  Make people
    use --rsh explicitly (maybe add a warning first?)
- logging!
- add RMFILES to compliment NEWFILES for diff?
- add --remove/uninstall of roll to clean up
- add --rollback and tests to rolls?
- add --reporting
- add --lint (best practices check)
- add --show-deps?
- add --explicit-roles option that enables specifying roles on the command line
    but defaults to on.  but you can disable this in slack.conf if you want to
    avoid admin errors.
- make slack-getroles use slack-sync, so only slack-sync needs to know about
    how to get stuff from source, and we can more easily add support
    for other roles sources
- in rolediff, feed the files to slack-diff via stdin or something to speed
    things up.
- in --preview=prompt, add per file skip instead of files and/or scripts (requires modifications to rolediff)
- fully support alternate diff programs (temp files or fds for modes with
    filename and attribute in the text; honor DIFF env var or something)
- Slack.pm: in find_files_to_install(), probably better to hand the callback a
    relative path (sub out ^$source/).
- make run_backend() do the printing to stderr and dereferencing backend flags
- make slack-getroles work for non-superusers (by caching the role list in /tmp
    or something)
- write unit tests for slack-stage changes (--subdir support)
- more unit tests for slack-diff
    we can use fakeroot if avail and skip some tests if non-root
- manpage update:
    describe order of operations
- add functionality to check manually-supplied role list against list in
    slack-getroles, with option to override
- just skip syncing if source equals cache.
- use an "install" script, if present, instead of built-in
    file install routines
- export dry-run, backup, backup-dir if they exist
- support preview
    add a flag to run script in preview with a dry-run flag or env
- function library for shell scripts
- update url in rpm spec
- create deb package
- in RPM, deb, create subdirs of CACHE
- a push script to read roles.conf and push a role to all servers running it
- defaults for slack.conf in Slack.pm or somewhere?  (so people don't have to
    keep patching as new variables are introduced...)
- Figure out some better way to handle backup options:
    - by default, we want admins to just specify the base backup dir in config,
      and we can add the time-based subdir to it
    - we generally want only installfiles to do backups (given the existence
        of fixfiles, it's pretty useless for slack-sync)
    - if we're doing backups in slack-sync, we need to append
        files(.subrole)?|scripts
    - rsync really hates whatever fixfiles does with symlinks in the
        accounts role.  it's probably a bug.  track it down.
    - before running scripts, install them in some other directory, so we
        can keep track of the last script we ran for backup and warning
        purposes.  (just doing it in slack-sync wouldn't work for nagging
        or warning purposes).  Probably we'll have to install them all
        at once, since we don't know what other files in the scripts/
        directory they may use.
- Nagging
    - we want to be able to nag admins about files they have not yet installed
        or scripts they have not yet run
- separate slack-runscript, slack-runfixfiles
- allow ./configure to set paths
- manpages for slack, slack-backends
- record what roles have been installed
- build in support for heterogenous underlying distros, like subsets have
  (maybe just using subroles)
- Nagging email about pending changes
- Use backup functionality to store original versions of files,
  so we can uninstall
- Use backups to store intermediate versions of files for rollbacks
- Make a helper that uses tripwire or AIDE to find files that
  have been modified and upload them to repository, so people
  can be *really* lazy.
- Locking to prevent concurrent writes
- something like rpm -ql, -qf to show/query files in a role (just from files
    dir)
- use a tarball as a source (possibly fetched with wget)
- support http urls (with wget), both as raw dir trees and as tar.gz files
- use rsync+ssh to mean rsync -e ssh (like svn)
- maybe split the getting stuff in sync/getroles from the syncing stuff in stage, so we can have a common backend for various URLs
